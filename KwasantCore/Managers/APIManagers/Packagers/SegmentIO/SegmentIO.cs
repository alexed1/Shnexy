//When a user visits Kwasant, we try three ways to get their ID:
//1) If they're already logged in, we use their userID from the database
//2) If they're not logged in, we check their userID from a cookie we set (sessionID)
//3) If they don't have a cookie, we generate a new ID based on ASP's session
//When an unknown user performs actions, we log it under their ID taken from above (usually from the ASP session ID). If they then sign in, we push an alias between their previous session ID, and their new logged-in ID.
//This means, the following workflow:
//Anonymous user visits kwasant.com
//Anonymous user plays the video
//Anonymous user signs in as 'rjrudman@gmail.com'.
//When viewing the profile for 'rjrudman@gmail.com' - the first two actions are properly retrieved.
//Also - when submitting the 'Try it out' form, we link them to the user which is generated for that email. Although it's not perfect (they can enter any email) - it helps give us an idea of who's who. From then on, all actions they've done in the past and future will be aggregated to the submitted email (as well as any other accounts they register, assuming cookies aren't cleared, which we can't do anything about. Aggregation only works for the most recently used account, however).
//Still working through updating our templated emails. I've taken advantage of the token authorization, which automatically logs them in when clicking on it - so the tracking works better. This also works regardless of them having cookies or not
//The basic work is now done - to add more tracking, we just need to add more analytics.track('someEvent') - the rest of the identify and aliasing should be done automatically.
//Server side, we have the following methods:
//void Identify(String userID);
//void Identify(UserDO userDO);
//void Track(UserDO userDO, String eventName, String action, Dictionary<String, object> properties = null);
//void Track(UserDO userDO, String eventName, Dictionary<String, object> properties = null);
//Example:
//ObjectFactory.GetInstance<ISegmentIO>().Track(bookingRequestDO.User, "BookingRequest", "Submit", new Dictionary<string, object> "BookingRequestId", bookingRequestDO.Id);
//They also help to push changes to a user (ie, name change, email change, etc, etc). Already setup to be mockable if needed
